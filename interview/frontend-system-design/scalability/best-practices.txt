Scalable Frontend Application Development Flow
===============================================

1️⃣ Planning & Project Setup
----------------------------
→ Choose the framework (active development, community support, libraries)
→ Define efficient folder structure (splits by features,logic, reusable, Git ignores)
→ Decide naming conventions (PascalCase --components,props etc, camelCase -- data, kebab-case -- urls,file/folder names etc.)
→ Set up style guides and linters (ESLint, Prettier)
→ Configure TypeScript for static type checks
→ Plan CSS strategy (BEM, CSS modules, Tailwind CSS)
→ Design tokens are the building blocks of a design system. They ensure consistency, scalability, and maintainability of UI design across platforms & follow accessibility guidelines.

2️⃣ Development Best Practices
------------------------------
→ Apply Single Responsibility Principle (functions/components)
→ Avoid deep nesting
→ Follow DRY (reusable components/functions in common/utils)
→ Write modular, reusable, maintainable code
→ Follow clean code principles
→ Use responsive design & mobile-first approach

3️⃣ Performance Optimization During Development
------------------------------------------------
→ Lazy loading (images, data, components)
→ Code splitting, minification, compression
→ Debounce/throttle for optimized interactions

4️⃣ Pre-Commit & Quality Checks
-------------------------------
→ Husky/pre-commit hooks to run:
    - Lint checks
    - Code formatting
    - Automated tests (unit/integration/E2E)
→ Commit only if checks pass
→ Update documentation (Confluence, Google Docs)

5️⃣ Post-Commit & Review Process
--------------------------------
→ Code reviews
→ Design reviews
→ QA testing (sanity/feature)

6️⃣ Deployment
--------------
→ Deploy after tests, reviews, and performance checks pass
→ Use CI/CD pipelines for consistency

7️⃣ Monitor & Maintain
----------------------
→ Keep libraries/frameworks updated
→ DAILY: Monitor site performance metrics
→ WEEKLY: Check error logs (Sentry)
→ MONTHLY: Analyze user feedback, reviews, surveys
→ QUARTERLY: Performance audits & design refactoring
→ Act on feedback loops
→ Schedule code cleanup & refactoring





Scalable frontend application : 
1/ https://dev.to/amirrezasalimi/modular-architecture-for-scalable-frontend-development-2emb 
- For files & folder follow the kebab-case, keep every file within a module/folder
- Create folder for features, keep features level folders like components, utility functions, hooks, constants, stores. We can have the same at project level.
- Clear variable, component, file/folder names reduces the cognitive load
2/ Frontend scale
- https://frontendatscale.com/issues/1/
- Title : all about complexity
- 1/ what is complexity -> Anything that make codebase —> harder to change/understand, high cognitive load(unclear variable, file, folder or component names, unorganised codebase), unknown unknown effects, changes amplification
- https://frontendatscale.com/issues/3 
- Title : Technical depth and breadth 
- 1/ stuffs u know — depth, stuffs u know, u don’t know — breadth
- 2/ Visualise the architecture before building to get better clarity, even at feature/project level
