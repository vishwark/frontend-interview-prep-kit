# Chat Application Data Models Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the data models used in the chat application. These models define the core entities, their relationships, and the data structures that support the application's functionality.

## Core Entities

The chat application is built around these primary entities:

### User

Represents a user of the application, including their profile information, authentication details, and preferences.

### Conversation

Represents a chat conversation, which can be either a one-on-one conversation between two users or a group conversation with multiple participants.

### Message

Represents a single message within a conversation, including text content, attachments, and metadata.

### Contact

Represents a relationship between users, including contact status and relationship metadata.

### Attachment

Represents a file or media item attached to a message, such as images, videos, documents, etc.

## Entity Relationships

The relationships between these entities are as follows:

- **User to Conversation**: Many-to-many relationship. A user can participate in multiple conversations, and a conversation can have multiple users.
- **Conversation to Message**: One-to-many relationship. A conversation contains multiple messages.
- **User to Message**: One-to-many relationship. A user can send multiple messages.
- **User to Contact**: Many-to-many relationship. A user can have multiple contacts, and a user can be a contact of multiple other users.
- **Message to Attachment**: One-to-many relationship. A message can have multiple attachments.

## Data Model Diagrams

For detailed entity relationship diagrams, please refer to the [relationships.md](./relationships.md) file.

## Type Definitions

The application uses TypeScript interfaces to define the structure of these entities. For detailed type definitions, please refer to the [entities.ts](./entities.ts) file.

## Data Validation

Data validation rules and JSON schemas for these entities are defined in the [schemas.md](./schemas.md) file.

## Data Storage Considerations

### Client-Side Storage

The application uses a combination of storage mechanisms on the client side:

1. **Redux Store**: In-memory storage for the current application state
2. **IndexedDB**: Persistent storage for message history, user data, and offline capabilities
3. **Local Storage**: Storage for user preferences and session information

### Server-Side Storage

On the server side, the application uses:

1. **MongoDB**: For storing messages and conversations (document-based data)
2. **PostgreSQL**: For storing user accounts, relationships, and structured data
3. **Redis**: For caching and real-time presence information
4. **Amazon S3**: For storing media attachments

## Data Flow

Data flows through the system as follows:

1. **User Input**: User creates or interacts with messages
2. **Client Processing**: The client processes and validates the data
3. **API Transmission**: Data is sent to the server via REST or GraphQL APIs
4. **Server Processing**: The server processes, validates, and stores the data
5. **Real-time Updates**: Updates are pushed to other clients via WebSockets
6. **Client Storage**: Data is stored locally for offline access and performance

## Data Consistency

To maintain data consistency across clients and the server:

1. **Optimistic Updates**: The client updates its local state immediately and rolls back if the server rejects the change
2. **Conflict Resolution**: The server resolves conflicts when multiple clients modify the same data
3. **Versioning**: Messages and conversations have version numbers to track changes
4. **Synchronization**: Clients periodically synchronize their local data with the server

## Data Security

The application implements several measures to secure user data:

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted on the client side before transmission
2. **Data Sanitization**: User input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks
3. **Access Control**: Data access is restricted based on user permissions
4. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored

## Data Migration and Evolution

As the application evolves:

1. **Schema Versioning**: Data schemas are versioned to support backward compatibility
2. **Migration Scripts**: Scripts are provided to migrate data between schema versions
3. **Feature Flags**: New data features can be gradually rolled out to users

## Detailed Documentation

For more detailed information about specific aspects of the data models, please refer to the following documents:

- [entities.ts](./entities.ts): TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- [schemas.md](./schemas.md): JSON schemas and validation rules
- [relationships.md](./relationships.md): Entity relationships and associations

## Conclusion

The data models in the chat application are designed to support real-time messaging, rich media sharing, and a seamless user experience across devices. The combination of client-side and server-side storage, along with careful attention to data consistency and security, ensures that the application can handle the complex requirements of modern chat applications.
