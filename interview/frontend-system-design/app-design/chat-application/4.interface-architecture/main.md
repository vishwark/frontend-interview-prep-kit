### Component Types

The application uses several types of components:

1. **Container Components**: Manage state and data fetching
2. **Presentational Components**: Render UI based on props
3. **Layout Components**: Handle page structure and responsive behavior
4. **Feature Components**: Implement specific application features
5. **Common Components**: Reusable UI elements used across the application

### Component Design Patterns

The application employs several component design patterns:

1. **Compound Components**: For related component groups (e.g., MessageItem and its children)
2. **Render Props**: For sharing behavior between components
3. **Higher-Order Components**: For cross-cutting concerns like authentication
4. **Custom Hooks**: For reusable logic and state management

## State Management

### State Architecture

The application uses a hybrid state management approach, which is detailed in the [state-management.md](./state-management.md) document:

1. **Global State**: Application-wide state managed with Redux
2. **Local State**: Component-specific state managed with React's useState and useReducer
3. **Server State**: Remote data managed with React Query
4. **Form State**: Form data managed with Formik or React Hook Form
5. **URL State**: Navigation state managed with React Router

### State Categories

The application state is divided into several categories:

1. **Authentication State**: User authentication status and tokens
2. **User State**: Current user profile and preferences
3. **Conversation State**: Active conversations and their metadata
4. **Message State**: Messages within conversations
5. **UI State**: Interface state like active modals, sidebars, etc.
6. **Network State**: Connection status and pending operations

## Routing Architecture

The application uses a nested routing structure, which is detailed in the [routing.md](./routing.md) document:

```
/
├── /login
├── /register
├── /forgot-password
├── /conversations
│   ├── /:conversationId
│   └── /new
├── /contacts
│   └── /:contactId
├── /settings
│   ├── /profile
│   ├── /preferences
│   └── /notifications
└── /search
    ├── /messages
    ├── /conversations
    └── /contacts
```

## Frontend Architecture

### Technology Stack

The application is built with the following core technologies:

1. **React**: UI library for building component-based interfaces
2. **TypeScript**: Static typing for improved developer experience and code quality
3. **Redux Toolkit**: State management for global application state
