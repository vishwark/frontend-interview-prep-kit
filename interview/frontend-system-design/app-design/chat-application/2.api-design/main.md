# Chat Application API Design Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the API design for the chat application. The API is designed to support real-time messaging, user management, and all other features required by the application. The API architecture combines REST and GraphQL endpoints, with WebSocket connections for real-time updates.

## API Architecture

The chat application uses a hybrid API architecture:

1. **GraphQL API**: Primary API for data fetching and mutations, providing flexible queries and reducing over-fetching
2. **REST API**: Used for specific endpoints where REST is more appropriate (authentication, file uploads)
3. **WebSocket API**: Handles real-time events such as message delivery, typing indicators, and presence updates

This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of each protocol:
- GraphQL for complex data requirements with minimal network requests
- REST for simpler, resource-oriented operations
- WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication

## API Layers

### 1. Authentication Layer
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Issues and validates JWT tokens
- Manages session state and security

### 2. Core API Layer
- User management
- Conversation management
- Message handling
- Contact management
- Search functionality

### 3. Real-time Layer
- Message delivery
- Typing indicators
- Presence updates
- Read receipts

### 4. Media Layer
- File uploads and downloads
- Media processing (image resizing, video transcoding)
- Media storage and retrieval

## API Versioning

The API uses URL-based versioning for REST endpoints and schema versioning for GraphQL:

- REST: `/api/v1/resource`
- GraphQL: Single endpoint at `/graphql` with schema versioning through directives

## Error Handling

The API implements a consistent error handling strategy:

- HTTP status codes for REST endpoints
- Error objects in GraphQL responses
- Standardized error codes and messages
- Detailed error information in development environments

## Rate Limiting

To protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage:

- Rate limits based on user tiers
- Token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- Clear rate limit headers in responses
- Graceful degradation when limits are reached

## API Documentation

The API is documented using:

- OpenAPI (Swagger) for REST endpoints
- GraphQL introspection and schema documentation
- Comprehensive examples and use cases

## Security Considerations

The API implements several security measures:

- HTTPS for all endpoints
- JWT-based authentication
- CSRF protection
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Content Security Policy

## API Endpoints Summary

### GraphQL Endpoints

- `/graphql`: Main GraphQL endpoint for queries and mutations

### REST Endpoints

- `/api/v1/auth`: Authentication endpoints
- `/api/v1/files`: File upload and download
- `/api/v1/users`: User management
- `/api/v1/health`: API health checks

### WebSocket Endpoints

- `/ws`: WebSocket connection for real-time events

## Detailed API Documentation

For detailed information about specific endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling, please refer to the following documents:

- [API Contracts](./contracts.md): Detailed endpoint specifications
- [Payload Examples](./payloads.md): Example request and response payloads
- [Error Handling](./error-handling.md): Error codes, messages, and handling strategies

## API Evolution Strategy

The API is designed to evolve over time while maintaining backward compatibility:

1. New features are added in a non-breaking manner
2. Deprecated fields and endpoints are marked before removal
3. Breaking changes are communicated well in advance
4. Multiple API versions are supported during transition periods

## Performance Considerations

The API is optimized for performance:

- Response caching where appropriate
- Query optimization for GraphQL
- Connection pooling for database access
- Efficient serialization/deserialization
- Compression for response payloads
