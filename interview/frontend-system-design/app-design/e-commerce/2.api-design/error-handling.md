## Error Response Format

All API errors follow a consistent JSON format to ensure predictable error handling on the client side:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found",
    "details": {
      "resourceType": "Product",
      "resourceId": "prod123"
    },
    "requestId": "req-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "timestamp": "2023-09-15T10:30:00Z",
    "path": "/api/v1/products/prod123",
    "validationErrors": []
  }
}
```

### Fields Explanation

- **code**: A machine-readable error code that uniquely identifies the error type
- **message**: A human-readable error message that describes the error
- **details**: Additional context-specific information about the error
- **requestId**: A unique identifier for the request, useful for tracing and debugging
- **timestamp**: The time when the error occurred
- **path**: The API endpoint path where the error occurred
- **validationErrors**: An array of validation errors (only present for validation errors)

## HTTP Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:

### Success Codes

- **200 OK**: The request was successful
- **201 Created**: The resource was successfully created
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return

### Client Error Codes

- **400 Bad Request**: The request was malformed or contains invalid parameters
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required or the provided credentials are invalid
- **403 Forbidden**: The authenticated user does not have permission to access the resource
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource was not found
- **409 Conflict**: The request conflicts with the current state of the resource
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: The request was well-formed but contains semantic errors

### Server Error Codes

- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unavailable
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server timed out waiting for a response from an upstream server

## Error Types and Codes

## Validation Errors

Validation errors include detailed information about each validation failure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "The request contains validation errors",
    "validationErrors": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "code": "INVALID_FORMAT",
        "message": "Email address is not in a valid format"
      },
      {
        "field": "password",
        "code": "INVALID_LENGTH",
        "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters long",
        "constraints": {
          "minLength": 8
        }
      }
    ],
    "requestId": "req-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "timestamp": "2023-09-15T10:30:00Z",
    "path": "/api/v1/auth/register"
  }
}
```

### Validation Error Fields

- **field**: The name of the field that failed validation
- **code**: A specific error code for the validation error
- **message**: A human-readable message describing the validation error
- **constraints**: Additional constraints that were violated (optional)

## Authentication and Authorization Errors

Authentication and authorization errors provide clear guidance on how to resolve the issue:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "TOKEN_EXPIRED",
    "message": "The authentication token has expired",
    "details": {
      "expiredAt": "2023-09-15T09:30:00Z",
      "tokenType": "access"
    },
    "requestId": "req-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "timestamp": "2023-09-15T10:30:00Z",
    "path": "/api/v1/users/me"
  }
}
```

For security reasons, some error details may be intentionally vague to prevent information leakage.

## Business Logic Errors

Business logic errors provide context-specific information to help users understand and resolve the issue:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_INVENTORY",
    "message": "The requested quantity exceeds the available inventory",
    "details": {
      "productId": "prod123",
      "requestedQuantity": 5,
      "availableQuantity": 3
    },
    "requestId": "req-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "timestamp": "2023-09-15T10:30:00Z",
    "path": "/api/v1/cart/items"
  }
}
```

## System Errors

System errors provide limited details to avoid exposing internal system information:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR",
    "message": "An unexpected error occurred. Our team has been notified.",
    "requestId": "req-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "timestamp": "2023-09-15T10:30:00Z",
    "path": "/api/v1/orders"
  }
}
```

Detailed error information is logged internally but not exposed in the API response.

## Retry Strategies

The API implements several retry strategies for handling transient errors:

### Automatic Retries

The server automatically retries certain operations that fail due to transient issues:

1. **Database Connection Errors**: Retried with exponential backoff
2. **External Service Timeouts**: Retried up to 3 times with increasing delays
3. **Rate Limiting**: Retried after the rate limit window expires
4. **Deadlocks**: Retried immediately up to 5 times

### Retry Headers

For client-initiated retries, the API provides guidance through response headers:

- **Retry-After**: Indicates the number of seconds to wait before retrying
- **X-RateLimit-Reset**: Indicates when the rate limit will reset
- **X-Backoff-Seconds**: Suggests a backoff period for exponential backoff

### Idempotency

To support safe retries, all mutation operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) support idempotency:

1. **Idempotency Keys**: Clients can provide an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique value
2. **Request Deduplication**: Duplicate requests with the same idempotency key return the same response
3. **Expiration**: Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours

Example:

```
POST /api/v1/orders
Idempotency-Key: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

## Fallback Mechanisms

The API implements fallback mechanisms to maintain service availability during partial outages:

### Service Degradation

1. **Read-Only Mode**: During write service outages, the API may enter read-only mode
2. **Feature Flags**: Critical features remain available while non-critical features are disabled
3. **Cached Responses**: Stale data may be served with appropriate cache headers

### Circuit Breaking

1. **Service Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures by failing fast when dependencies are unavailable
2. **Gradual Recovery**: Circuit breakers implement half-open states to test recovery
3. **Fallback Responses**: Default or cached responses are provided when services are unavailable

### Graceful Degradation

1. **Simplified Responses**: Complex aggregated responses may be simplified during high load
2. **Pagination Limits**: Result set sizes may be reduced during high load
3. **Timeout Adjustments**: Request timeouts may be reduced to prevent resource exhaustion

## Error Logging and Monitoring

All errors are logged and monitored to ensure timely detection and resolution:

### Error Logging

1. **Structured Logging**: All errors are logged in a structured format with consistent fields
2. **Log Levels**: Errors are categorized by severity (ERROR, WARN, INFO)
3. **Context Preservation**: Request context is included in all error logs
4. **PII Filtering**: Personally identifiable information is filtered from logs

### Error Monitoring

1. **Real-time Alerts**: Critical errors trigger immediate alerts
2. **Error Aggregation**: Similar errors are grouped to prevent alert fatigue
3. **Error Trends**: Increasing error rates trigger alerts even for non-critical errors
4. **SLA Monitoring**: Errors affecting service level agreements are prioritized

### Error Analytics

1. **Error Dashboards**: Real-time dashboards show error rates and trends
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Automated analysis identifies common factors in errors
3. **User Impact Assessment**: Errors are correlated with user sessions to assess impact
4. **Error Resolution Tracking**: Time to detection and resolution is tracked

## Client-Side Error Handling

Guidelines for client applications to handle API errors effectively:

### Error Detection

1. **HTTP Status Codes**: Check HTTP status codes first
2. **Error Codes**: Use error codes for programmatic handling
3. **Network Errors**: Handle network-level errors separately from API errors

### Retry Logic

1. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter
2. **Retry Limits**: Limit the number of retries to prevent overwhelming the server
3. **Retry Only Idempotent Operations**: Only retry operations that are safe to repeat
4. **Respect Retry Headers**: Use server-provided retry guidance

### User Experience

1. **Friendly Error Messages**: Translate error codes to user-friendly messages
2. **Recovery Options**: Provide clear next steps for users to recover
3. **Offline Support**: Cache critical data for offline operation
4. **Background Retries**: Retry operations in the background when possible

### Error Reporting

1. **Client-Side Logging**: Log errors on the client side
2. **Error Telemetry**: Send anonymized error reports to improve the API
3. **Correlation IDs**: Include request IDs in error reports for correlation
4. **User Feedback**: Allow users to provide additional context for errors
