## API Architecture

The e-commerce application implements a hybrid API architecture that combines REST and GraphQL approaches to leverage the strengths of each:

### REST API

The primary API architecture follows RESTful principles for standard CRUD operations and resource-based endpoints. This approach provides:

- Familiar patterns for common operations
- Effective caching through HTTP mechanisms
- Stateless interactions for scalability
- Clear resource hierarchies
- Standard HTTP methods and status codes

### GraphQL API

For complex data requirements and aggregations, the application implements a GraphQL API that provides:

- Flexible data fetching with precise field selection
- Reduced network requests for complex UI components
- Strongly typed schema
- Introspection capabilities
- Real-time updates through subscriptions

### API Gateway

An API Gateway sits in front of both REST and GraphQL APIs to provide:

- Unified entry point for all API requests
- Authentication and authorization
- Request routing
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Monitoring and analytics
- CORS handling

## Design Principles

The API design adheres to the following principles:

### 1. Resource-Oriented Design

- APIs are organized around resources (products, orders, users)
- Resources are identified by URLs
- Standard HTTP methods indicate actions on resources
- Relationships between resources are represented through links

### 2. Consistency

- Consistent naming conventions (plural nouns for collections)
- Consistent URL patterns
- Consistent error handling
- Consistent pagination, filtering, and sorting mechanisms
- Consistent date/time formats (ISO 8601)

### 3. Simplicity and Intuitiveness

- Straightforward endpoint naming
- Intuitive resource hierarchies
- Minimal required parameters
- Sensible defaults
- Self-documenting where possible

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Efficient payload design
- Support for partial responses
- Pagination for large collections
- Asynchronous processing for time-consuming operations
- Optimized query patterns

### 5. Security by Design

- Authentication for all non-public endpoints
- Authorization checks for all protected resources
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common API vulnerabilities
- Secure handling of sensitive data

## API Versioning

The API implements versioning to ensure backward compatibility while allowing evolution:

### Versioning Strategy

- URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/products`)
- Major version changes for breaking changes
- Maintenance of previous versions during transition periods
- Deprecation notices and sunset policies
- Version-specific documentation

### Version Lifecycle

1. **Active Development**: Latest version with ongoing enhancements
2. **Stable**: Current recommended version
3. **Deprecated**: Still functional but scheduled for removal
4. **Sunset**: No longer available

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

1. **JWT-based Authentication**
   - Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens
   - Refresh token mechanism for session management
   - Token revocation capabilities

2. **OAuth 2.0 Integration**
   - Support for social login providers
   - Authorization code flow for web applications
   - Implicit flow for SPA applications
   - Client credentials for service-to-service communication

3. **API Keys**
   - For partner integrations and third-party services
   - Rate limiting tied to API keys
   - Scoped access based on API key permissions

### Authorization Model

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Predefined roles (customer, admin, support, partner)
   - Role-specific permissions
   - Role assignment and management

2. **Resource-Level Permissions**
   - Owner-based access control
   - Shared resource permissions
   - Hierarchical permission inheritance

3. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - Context-aware authorization decisions
   - Time-based access restrictions
   - Location-based restrictions for sensitive operations

## Rate Limiting and Throttling

### Rate Limiting Strategy

1. **Tiered Rate Limits**
   - Different limits for different user types
   - Higher limits for authenticated users
   - Premium tiers with increased limits

2. **Granular Limiting**
   - Endpoint-specific limits
   - Method-specific limits (higher limits for GET, lower for POST/PUT)
   - Resource-specific limits for high-demand resources

3. **Dynamic Rate Limiting**
   - Adaptive limits based on system load
   - Temporary limit reductions during peak periods
   - Gradual recovery after limit breaches

### Rate Limit Headers

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in a period
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current period
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the limit resets
- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait when rate limited

## Caching Strategy

### Cache Levels

1. **HTTP Caching**
   - ETag support for conditional requests
   - Cache-Control headers for client and CDN caching
   - Vary headers for response differentiation

2. **Application-Level Caching**
   - Redis-based caching for frequently accessed resources
   - Cached query results for complex operations
   - Distributed cache for multi-instance deployments

3. **CDN Integration**
   - Edge caching for static resources
   - Cache invalidation through purge requests
   - Surrogate-Control headers for CDN-specific instructions

### Cache Invalidation

- Time-based expiration for relatively static data
- Event-based invalidation for modified resources
- Selective invalidation to minimize cache churn
- Cache versioning for bulk invalidation

## API Documentation

### Documentation Approach

1. **OpenAPI Specification**
   - Complete API description using OpenAPI 3.0
   - Machine-readable specification
   - Generated interactive documentation

2. **Developer Portal**
   - Interactive API explorer
   - Code samples in multiple languages
   - Authentication guides
   - Best practices and tutorials
   - Changelog and migration guides

3. **In-Code Documentation**
   - Detailed comments for all endpoints
   - Parameter descriptions and constraints
   - Response schema documentation
   - Error scenarios and handling

### Documentation Features

- Try-it-now functionality
- Request/response examples
- Error code reference
- SDK documentation
- Webhook integration guides
- GraphQL schema explorer

## API Monitoring and Analytics

### Monitoring Metrics

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time (average, percentiles)
   - Request volume
   - Error rates
   - Cache hit/miss ratios
   - Endpoint popularity

2. **Health Metrics**
   - Availability percentage
   - Success rate by endpoint
   - Authentication failures
   - Rate limit hits
   - Unusual traffic patterns

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Conversion-related API calls
   - Cart abandonment indicators
   - Search query analytics
   - Feature usage statistics
   - User journey mapping

### Alerting Strategy

- Threshold-based alerts for critical metrics
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Escalation policies for different severity levels
- Automated incident response for common issues
- On-call rotation for critical issues

## API Evolution Strategy

### Backward Compatibility

- Additive changes preferred over breaking changes
- Support for deprecated fields during transition periods
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Compatibility layers for major transitions
- Comprehensive migration guides

### API Lifecycle Management

1. **Design Phase**
   - RFC process for significant changes
   - Developer feedback collection
   - Prototype testing with key partners
   - Performance and security review

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Feature flagging for controlled rollout
   - Canary testing with subset of traffic
   - Comprehensive testing with realistic data
   - Documentation updates

3. **Deprecation Phase**
   - Advance notice of deprecations (minimum 6 months)
   - Alternative implementation guidance
   - Monitoring of deprecated feature usage
   - Direct communication with affected partners

4. **Retirement Phase**
   - Final notice period
   - Graceful error responses for retired endpoints
   - Archive of historical API versions
   - Post-retirement support options
