## Core Entities

The e-commerce application is built around the following core entities:

### User

Represents a registered user of the application, including customers, administrators, and other role-based users.

**Key attributes:**
- User identification and authentication details
- Personal information (name, contact details)
- Preferences and settings
- Addresses (shipping, billing)
- Payment methods
- Order history

### Product

Represents items available for purchase in the store.

**Key attributes:**
- Product details (name, description, images)
- Categorization and tagging
- Pricing information
- Inventory status
- Variants and options
- Attributes and specifications
- SEO metadata

### Category

Represents a hierarchical classification system for organizing products.

**Key attributes:**
- Category details (name, description, image)
- Parent-child relationships
- Associated products
- Display order and visibility
- SEO metadata

### Cart

Represents a user's shopping cart containing items they intend to purchase.

**Key attributes:**
- Cart items (products, quantities, selected options)
- Price calculations (subtotal, discounts, taxes, shipping)
- Associated user or guest identifier
- Creation and expiration timestamps

### Order

Represents a completed purchase transaction.

**Key attributes:**
- Order details (number, status, dates)
- Ordered items (products, quantities, prices at time of purchase)
- Customer information
- Shipping and billing addresses
- Payment information
- Fulfillment details
- Price calculations (subtotal, discounts, taxes, shipping, total)

### Review

Represents customer feedback and ratings for products.

**Key attributes:**
- Review content (rating, title, text)
- Associated product
- Author information
- Timestamps
- Helpfulness metrics
- Moderation status

### Discount

Represents promotional offers and discounts applicable to products or orders.

**Key attributes:**
- Discount details (code, type, value)
- Validity period
- Usage restrictions
- Applicable products or categories
- Minimum purchase requirements
- Usage limits

## Data Model Design Principles

The data models in the e-commerce application adhere to the following design principles:

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Each entity model focuses on a specific domain concept, with clear boundaries and responsibilities. This approach:

- Improves maintainability by isolating changes to specific models
- Enhances readability by keeping models focused and concise
- Facilitates testing by allowing models to be tested in isolation
- Supports scalability by enabling independent scaling of different data domains

### 2. Single Source of Truth

Each piece of data has a single, authoritative source:

- Derived data is computed from source data rather than stored redundantly
- References are used instead of duplicating data across models
- When denormalization is necessary for performance, clear update patterns ensure consistency

### 3. Immutable History

Historical data is preserved to maintain audit trails and support analytics:

- Order data captures product information at the time of purchase
- Price changes are tracked with effective dates
- User actions are logged with timestamps and context
- Soft deletes are used to preserve historical records while removing them from active use

### 4. Extensibility

Models are designed to accommodate future extensions without requiring structural changes:

- Flexible attribute systems for products and categories
- Metadata fields for custom data requirements
- Versioned schemas to support backward compatibility
- Extension points for third-party integrations

### 5. Performance-Oriented Design

Data models are optimized for common access patterns:

- Denormalization where appropriate for read-heavy operations
- Indexing strategies based on query patterns
- Pagination support for large collections
- Caching-friendly data structures

## Schema Evolution Strategy

As the application evolves, data schemas need to adapt while maintaining compatibility with existing data. The following strategies are employed:

### 1. Versioned Schemas

- Each schema has an explicit version number
- New versions are backward compatible with previous versions
- Migration scripts handle conversion between versions
- The application supports multiple schema versions during transition periods

### 2. Additive Changes

Schema changes prioritize additive modifications:

- Adding new fields with default values
- Extending enumerations with new values
- Creating new related entities instead of modifying existing ones
- Deprecating fields before removal

### 3. Migration Approach

Data migrations follow a staged approach:

1. **Dual-write phase**: Write to both old and new schemas
2. **Backfill phase**: Migrate existing data to the new schema
3. **Dual-read phase**: Read from new schema, fall back to old schema
4. **Cleanup phase**: Remove old schema support after full migration

### 4. Schema Registry

A central schema registry maintains:

- Current and historical schema definitions
- Compatibility rules between versions
- Documentation of schema changes
- Validation rules for each schema version

## Data Validation Approach

Data integrity is ensured through comprehensive validation:

### 1. Multi-layer Validation

Validation occurs at multiple layers:

- **Client-side**: Immediate feedback for user inputs
- **API layer**: Request payload validation before processing
- **Service layer**: Business rule validation
- **Data layer**: Schema constraints and database validations

### 2. Validation Rules

Validation rules are defined for:

- **Type validation**: Ensuring data is of the correct type
- **Format validation**: Checking that data follows required patterns
- **Range validation**: Verifying numeric values are within acceptable ranges
- **Reference validation**: Confirming that referenced entities exist
- **Business rule validation**: Enforcing domain-specific constraints

### 3. Error Handling

Validation errors are handled with:

- Descriptive error messages for each validation failure
- Error codes for programmatic handling
- Field-level error attribution
- Aggregated validation results for multiple errors

## Data Consistency Considerations

Maintaining data consistency is critical for e-commerce operations:

### 1. Transaction Boundaries

Clear transaction boundaries ensure:

- Atomic operations for critical workflows
- Consistent state transitions
- Proper error handling and rollback
- Isolation between concurrent operations

### 2. Eventual Consistency

For distributed operations:

- Event-based synchronization between services
- Compensation mechanisms for failed operations
- Reconciliation processes for detecting and resolving inconsistencies
- Clear visibility of consistency status

### 3. Conflict Resolution

When conflicts occur:

- Optimistic concurrency control with version checking
- Merge strategies for reconcilable conflicts
- User-driven resolution for business-level conflicts
- Audit trails of conflict resolution decisions

## Performance Optimizations

Data models are optimized for performance:

### 1. Denormalization Strategies

Strategic denormalization improves read performance:

- Frequently accessed data is denormalized to reduce joins
- Aggregated values are precomputed and stored
- Read models are separated from write models
- Denormalized data is kept in sync through event-driven updates

### 2. Indexing Strategy

Indexes are designed based on:

- Common query patterns
- Sort operations
- Filter conditions
- Relationship traversals

### 3. Pagination and Partitioning

Large datasets are managed through:

- Cursor-based pagination for consistent results
- Time-based partitioning for historical data
- Sharding strategies for horizontal scaling
- Materialized views for complex aggregations

### 4. Caching Considerations

Data models support efficient caching:

- Cache-friendly identifiers
- TTL (Time-To-Live) metadata
- Cache invalidation hooks
- Partial update support
