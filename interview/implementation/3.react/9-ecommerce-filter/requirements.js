 * 9. Filter tags/chips that show active filters and allow removal
 * 
 * Technical requirements:

 * - Implement URL parameter synchronization with filter state
 * - Handle filter dependencies (some filters may affect available options in others)
 * - Create smooth animations for filter changes
 * - Implement efficient filtering logic (minimize re-renders)
 * - Support for clearing individual filters or all filters at once
 * - Handle loading states while applying filters
 * - Make filters accessible (proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
