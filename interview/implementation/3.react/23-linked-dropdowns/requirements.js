/**
 * Linked Dropdowns Requirements
 * 
 * Create two dropdowns where the selection in the first filters the options in the second:
 * 
 * 1. Implement a primary dropdown:
 *    - Display a list of categories or parent items
 *    - Handle selection of an item
 *    - Trigger update of the secondary dropdown
 * 
 * 2. Implement a secondary dropdown:
 *    - Display options filtered based on the primary selection
 *    - Update options whenever the primary selection changes
 *    - Handle selection of filtered items
 * 
 * 3. Additional features:
 *    - Support for default/initial selections
 *    - Handle loading states while fetching options
 *    - Support for search/filter within each dropdown
 *    - Clear selection functionality
 *    - Support for disabled options
 * 
 * Technical requirements:
 * - Create reusable dropdown components
 * - Implement proper state management between the dropdowns
 * - Handle edge cases (no selection, no matching items)
 * - Support keyboard navigation and accessibility
 * - Create smooth animations for option changes
 * - Support for different data sources (static, API)
 * - Handle large datasets efficiently
