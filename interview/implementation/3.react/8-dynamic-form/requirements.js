/**
 * Dynamic Form with Backend Configuration Requirements
 * 
 * Implement a dynamic form system that renders based on configuration from a backend:
 * 
 * 1. Fetch form configuration from an API endpoint
 * 2. Dynamically render form fields based on the configuration:
 *    - Text inputs (single line, multi-line)
 *    - Select dropdowns (single and multi-select)
 *    - Checkboxes and radio buttons
 *    - Date pickers
 *    - File uploads
 *    - Custom field types
 * 3. Implement form validation based on rules from the configuration
 * 4. Support conditional fields (show/hide based on other field values)
 * 5. Handle form submission and display success/error messages
 * 6. Support for form sections and multi-step forms
 * 
 * Technical requirements:
 * - Create a flexible form rendering engine
 * - Implement a validation system that works with the dynamic fields
 * - Handle loading, error, and success states
 * - Make the form accessible (proper labels, error messages, etc.)
 * - Implement proper state management for form values
 * - Create a mock API for form configuration (or use a real backend)
 * - Support for form data persistence (save draft, resume later)
