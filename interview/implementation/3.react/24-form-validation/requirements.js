/**
 * Form Data Validation and State Management Requirements
 * 
 * Implement a form with comprehensive validation and state management:
 * 
 * 1. Create a form with various field types:
 *    - Text inputs (with different validation rules)
 *    - Email input with email validation
 *    - Password input with strength requirements
 *    - Number inputs with min/max validation
 *    - Select dropdowns
 *    - Checkboxes and radio buttons
 *    - File uploads with type and size validation
 * 
 * 2. Implement form validation:
 *    - Required field validation
 *    - Format validation (email, phone, etc.)
 *    - Custom validation rules
 *    - Cross-field validation (e.g., password confirmation)
 *    - Asynchronous validation (e.g., username availability)
 * 
 * 3. Manage form state:
 *    - Track field values
 *    - Track field errors
 *    - Track touched/dirty state
 *    - Handle form submission
 *    - Display success/error messages
 * 
 * Technical requirements:
 * - Use React hooks for state management
 * - Create reusable form components
 * - Implement proper form accessibility
 * - Handle form submission with proper error handling
 * - Create a responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
 * - Support for different validation libraries (optional)
