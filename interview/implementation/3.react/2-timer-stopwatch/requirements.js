/**
 * Timer/Stopwatch Requirements
 * 
 * Implement a timer/stopwatch application with the following features:
 * 
 * 1. Start the timer/stopwatch
 * 2. Pause the timer/stopwatch
 * 3. Record lap times while the stopwatch is running
 * 4. Reset the timer/stopwatch to zero
 * 5. Display time in hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds format
 * 6. Display a list of recorded lap times
 * 7. Calculate and display statistics like fastest lap, slowest lap, average lap time
 * 
 * Technical requirements:
 * - Use React hooks for state management and side effects
 * - Implement accurate time tracking (consider using setInterval or requestAnimationFrame)
 * - Handle edge cases (e.g., pausing, resuming)
 * - Create a clean and intuitive UI
 * - Ensure the timer continues to run even when other components update
