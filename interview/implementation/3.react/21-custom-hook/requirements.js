/**
 * Custom Hooks Requirements
 * 
 * Create custom React hooks with the following features:
 * 
 * 1. Implement a useLocalStorage hook that persists state in localStorage
 *    - Automatically save state changes to localStorage
 *    - Load initial state from localStorage if available
 *    - Support for different data types (strings, objects, arrays)
 * 
 * 2. Implement a useDebounce hook
 *    - Delay the execution of a function until after a specified wait time
 *    - Cancel previous executions when a new value is provided
 *    - Support for immediate execution option
 * 
 * 3. Implement a useThrottle hook
 *    - Limit the execution rate of a function
 *    - Ensure function executes at most once per specified time period
 *    - Support for leading and trailing execution options
 * 
 * 4. Implement a useFetch hook
 *    - Wrapper around fetch API with better state management
 *    - Handle loading, error, and success states
 *    - Support for request cancellation
 *    - Automatic retries for failed requests
 * 
 * 5. Implement a useIntersectionObserver hook
 *    - Track when an element enters or exits the viewport
 *    - Support for lazy loading images or infinite scrolling
 *    - Configurable threshold and root margin options
 * 
 * 6. Implement a useForm hook for form state management
 *    - Track form field values
 *    - Handle form validation
 *    - Manage form submission state
 *    - Support for field errors and touched states
 * 
 * 7. Implement a useWindowSize hook
 *     - Track window dimensions
 *     - Update when window is resized
 *     - Debounce resize events for performance
 * 
 * 8. Implement a useAsync hook for handling asynchronous operations
 *    - Track loading, error, and success states
 *    - Support for cancellation
 *    - Handle retry functionality
 *    - Cache results when appropriate
 * 
 * 9. Implement a useClickOutside hook
 *    - Detect clicks outside a specified element
 *    - Trigger callback when outside click is detected
 *    - Support for multiple elements
 * 
 * 10. Implement a useMediaQuery hook
 *    - Track if a media query matches the current viewport
 *    - Update when viewport changes
 *    - Support for different query types (width, height, orientation)
 * 
 * Technical requirements:
 * - Follow React Hooks best practices and rules
 * - Create comprehensive TypeScript types/interfaces
 * - Write tests for each hook
 * - Create example components that demonstrate hook usage
 * - Document the API and usage patterns
 * - Handle edge cases and error scenarios
