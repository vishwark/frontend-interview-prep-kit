/**
 * Drag and Drop Interface Requirements
 * 
 * Implement a drag and drop interface with the following features:
 * 
 * 1. Draggable items:
 *    - Allow elements to be dragged
 *    - Visual feedback during drag (shadow, opacity change)
 *    - Custom drag handles (optional)
 *    - Drag constraints (limit to specific areas)
 * 
 * 2. Drop zones:
 *    - Define areas where items can be dropped
 *    - Visual feedback when draggable hovers over drop zone
 *    - Accept or reject items based on type/criteria
 *    - Handle the drop event with proper data transfer
 * 
 * 3. Use cases to implement:
 *    - Sortable list (reorder items by dragging)
 *    - Kanban board (move items between columns)
 *    - File upload via drag and drop
 *    - Drag to resize or reposition elements
 * 
 * Technical requirements:
 * - Use React DnD, react-beautiful-dnd, or native HTML5 drag and drop
 * - Implement proper accessibility features
 * - Create smooth animations for drag and drop operations
 * - Handle touch devices and mouse interactions
 * - Support for keyboard navigation as an alternative
 * - Handle edge cases (invalid drops, cancellation)
 * - Optimize performance for many draggable items
