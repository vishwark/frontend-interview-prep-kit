/**
 * Breadcrumb Component Requirements
 * 
 * Build a breadcrumb navigation component with the following features:
 * 
 * 1. Display the current location path in a hierarchical structure
 * 2. Make each segment clickable to navigate to that level
 * 3. Support for custom separators between segments
 * 4. Handle long paths with truncation or wrapping
 * 5. Support for icons in breadcrumb items
 * 6. Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
 * 7. Support for dynamic breadcrumb generation based on routes
 * 8. Optional dropdown for intermediate levels when space is limited
 * 
 * Technical requirements:
 * - Create a reusable component that works with React Router or Next.js
 * - Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA attributes)
 * - Support for custom styling and theming
 * - Handle edge cases (root level, missing segments)
 * - Create smooth animations for hover states
 * - Support for programmatic updates when routes change
 * - Make the component configurable through props
