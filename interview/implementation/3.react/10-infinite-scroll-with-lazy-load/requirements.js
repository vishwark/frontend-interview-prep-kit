/**
 * Infinite Scroll Implementation Requirements
 * 
 * Implement an infinite scroll component with the following features:
 * 
 * 1. Load initial set of items
 * 2. Automatically load more items when the user scrolls near the bottom
 * 3. Display a loading indicator while fetching more items
 * 4. Handle errors during data fetching
 * 5. Support for different content types (text, images, cards, etc.)
 * 6. Maintain scroll position when new items are added
 * 7. Implement a "scroll to top" button
 * 8. Support for filtering or searching within the infinite list
 * 
 * Technical requirements:
 * - Use Intersection Observer API or scroll events for detection
 * - Implement efficient rendering (virtualization for large lists)
 * - Handle loading states and error states
 * - Create smooth animations for new content
 * - Implement proper accessibility features
 * - Handle edge cases (slow network, failed requests)
 * - Support for different screen sizes and orientations
 * - Implement proper memory management (cleanup event listeners)
