1/ Difference between Jest and RTL, usecases of each. Do they complement each other? 
2/ what is flaky testing?
3/ Can we skip RTL if we just need non-ui function/api implementations testing?
4/ How to write the test cases?
5/ what are the best practices for test cases in react based applications?
6/ What are common mistakes that needs to be avoided for test cases?
7/ What is snapshot testing?
8/ What is assertion testing?
9/ What are the difference between Snapshot and Assertion testing? When to use which one?
10/ How to test things in a react way ? like components, hooks, utility, functions etc.



1. Unit Tests (Base Layer — Jest)
- Fast, isolated, no DOM needed.
- Covers business logic, hooks, utils, API calls.
- Example: calcDiscount(), useDebounce().
- Ratio: ~60% of tests.

2. Integration / Component Tests (Middle Layer — Jest + RTL)
- Render components and simulate real user interactions.
- Covers local state, props, UI behavior, global state providers (Redux/Context).
- Example: “Clicking Add to Cart increases cart count.”
- Ratio: ~30% of tests.

3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Top Layer — Cypress/Playwright)
- Run app in a browser → test full flows with real backend or mocked APIs.
- Covers critical user journeys.
- Example: “User can register → login → buy a product → see order confirmation.”
- Ratio: ~10% of tests.
